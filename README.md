# Web3 Godmode Config

Claude Code configuration for web3 polyglot engineers. Solidity + Rust + TypeScript/React, multi-chain.

Designed to work standalone or alongside the [compound-engineering](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-plugins) plugin for maximum capability.

## Prerequisites

- [Claude Code CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) installed
- Python 3 (for hooks)
- jq (for todo-enforcer hook): `brew install jq`
- Optional: [compound-engineering plugin](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-plugins) for 27 additional review/analysis agents

## Installation

### Quick Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0xinit/web3-godmode-config.git
cd web3-godmode-config
./install.sh
```

The installer will:
1. Check prerequisites
2. Detect compound-engineering plugin
3. Backup existing `~/.claude/` config
4. Copy all files to `~/.claude/`
5. Register hooks in `settings.json`
6. Verify installation

### Manual Install

```bash
# Copy everything to ~/.claude/
cp CLAUDE.md ~/.claude/
cp -r agents/ ~/.claude/agents/
cp -r skills/ ~/.claude/skills/
cp -r rules/ ~/.claude/rules/
cp -r commands/ ~/.claude/commands/
cp -r hooks/ ~/.claude/hooks/

# Make hooks executable
chmod +x ~/.claude/hooks/*.py ~/.claude/hooks/*.sh
```

Then manually add hooks to `~/.claude/settings.json` (see install.sh for hook config).

### Selective Install

Only want specific skills? Copy individual directories:

```bash
# Just the Solidity skills
cp -r skills/solidity-security/ ~/.claude/skills/
cp -r skills/web3-foundry/ ~/.claude/skills/
cp rules/solidity.md ~/.claude/rules/

# Just the React skills
cp -r skills/react-useeffect/ ~/.claude/skills/
cp -r skills/vercel-react-best-practices/ ~/.claude/skills/

# Just a single chain
cp -r skills/web3-megaeth/ ~/.claude/skills/
cp -r skills/arbitrum-dapp-skill/ ~/.claude/skills/
```

## Customization

### Adding a New Chain

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/web3-YOUR-CHAIN/
```

Create a `SKILL.md` inside:
```markdown
---
name: web3-your-chain
description: Your Chain development reference. Use when deploying to or building on Your Chain.
---

# Your Chain Reference

## Chain Configuration
| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Chain ID | ... |
| RPC URL | ... |
| Explorer | ... |
| Faucet | ... |

## Deployment Patterns
...
```

Then add it to two places:
1. `CLAUDE.md` — add a row to the skill trigger table
2. `rules/forge.md` — add a row to the chain configuration table

### Modifying Rules

Rules in `rules/` are auto-loaded based on the file path you're editing. The `paths:` frontmatter controls when they activate:

```yaml
---
paths: "**/*.sol"  # Activates when editing any .sol file
---
```

**Examples:**

```yaml
# Only activate in a specific directory
paths: "contracts/**/*.sol"

# Activate for multiple extensions
paths: "**/*.{ts,tsx}"

# Activate for test files only
paths: "**/*.{test,spec}.ts, **/__tests__/**"

# Activate for config files
paths: "foundry.toml, hardhat.config.ts"
```

To create a new rule, add a `.md` file to `rules/` with the frontmatter and your rules below it.

### Adding a New Keyword Mode

Edit `hooks/keyword-detector.py` and add an entry to the `MODES` dict:

```python
"your-mode": {
    "pattern": r"\b(your-keyword|alias)\b",
    "context": """[YOUR MODE ACTIVATED]

Instructions that get injected into Claude's context when triggered...
"""
},
```

### Adjusting the Comment Checker

Edit `hooks/check-comments.py`:
- `MAX_COMMENT_RATIO` — change the threshold (default 25%)
- `VALID_PATTERNS` — add patterns that should NOT be flagged (e.g., your custom annotations)
- `CODE_EXTENSIONS` — add/remove file extensions to check

### Adding a New Command

Create a `.md` file in `commands/`:

```markdown
---
allowed-tools: Read, Glob, Grep, Bash
argument-hint: [your-args]
description: What this command does
---

Instructions for Claude when the user runs /your-command...
```

Usage: `/your-command [args]` in any Claude Code session.

### Adding a New Skill

Create a directory in `skills/` with a `SKILL.md`:

```markdown
---
name: your-skill
description: When to use this skill. Be specific — Claude uses this to decide when to auto-invoke.
---

# Your Skill

Reference content, patterns, code examples...
```

Set `disable-model-invocation: true` in the frontmatter if the skill should only run when manually invoked (not auto-triggered).

## Usage Examples

### Keyword Modes

Type these words anywhere in your prompt to activate specialized behavior:

```
ultrawork implement the staking contract
```
Activates maximum parallel execution, comprehensive planning, todo tracking.

```
analyze why the approve function reverts on Base
```
Activates deep investigation protocol with multi-phase analysis.

```
security review the vault contract
```
Routes to security scanning with Solidity-specific checks (reentrancy, CEI, access control).

```
deploy the NFT contract to Base mainnet
```
Activates deployment protocol — confirms chain, runs pre-deploy checks, verifies after.

All keyword modes:

| Keyword | What Happens |
|---------|-------------|
| `ultrawork` / `ulw` | Maximum parallel execution, comprehensive planning |
| `search` / `find` | Exhaustive multi-angle search |
| `analyze` / `debug` | Deep investigation with evidence gathering |
| `think deeply` | Extended reasoning with trade-off analysis |
| `refactor` | Incremental changes, behavior preservation, tests first |
| `review` | Routes to appropriate reviewer agent |
| `test` | BDD structure, edge cases, fuzz testing |
| `optimize` | Gas optimization (Solidity) or bundle/perf (React) |
| `security` / `audit` | Security scan (Solidity-specific or general) |
| `deploy` | Deployment protocol with chain awareness |

### Commands

```
/audit contracts/Vault.sol
```
Runs a structured security audit: static analysis, access control, reentrancy, economic vectors, gas DoS, events, NatSpec.

```
/deploy-check base MyToken
```
Pre-deployment verification: chain config, constructor args, proxy setup, post-deploy checks. Returns GO/NO-GO.

```
/interview docs/feature-spec.md
```
Interactive interview to flesh out a plan or spec. Asks deep questions about implementation, UX, tradeoffs.

### Skills Auto-Invoke

Skills trigger automatically based on what you're doing:

- Edit a `.sol` file → Solidity rules load + security skill available
- Write React hooks → useEffect patterns and Vercel best practices activate
- Ask about an EIP → EIP reference skill provides inline summaries
- Work on Anchor program → Rust patterns skill with account validation checks

### Compound-Engineering Integration

If you have the compound-engineering plugin installed, this config routes to its agents automatically:

| Need | Godmode Provides | Compound Provides |
|------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Solidity security | `/solidity-security` skill | `security-sentinel` agent |
| Code review | Rules + patterns | `kieran-*-reviewer` agents |
| Performance | Gas optimization skill | `performance-oracle` agent |
| Architecture | — | `architecture-strategist` agent |
| PR workflow | — | `/workflows:review` command |
| Frontend | Web3 frontend patterns | `frontend-design` skill |
| Git commits | — | `gitbahn` commands |

Both are triggered automatically via the CLAUDE.md delegation table — no manual routing needed.
